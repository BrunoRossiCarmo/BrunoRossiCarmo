### 🙌 Hello There! 🙌

I'm a **Biomedical Informatics** student of University of São Paulo - FMRP. Basically, you would think that name "Biomedical Informatics" doesn't make any sense at all, but trust me, biomedical information and data science aren't as far apart as you probably thought...
If you want to know more about my course, here's his page: [Biomedica Informatics - USP](https://ibm.fmrp.usp.br/) | [Institutional Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpGVfwBcSn0)

Exclusively, I'm working with Bioinformatics (*Computational Biology*), that the key objective here is study all the information about the omics areas, like:
- *Genomics* 🧬
- *Transcriptomics* 🧪
- *Proteomics* 🔬
- *Epigenomics* ⚗️
- *And much more stuff*...

**About Me:**
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a series of training analysis focus on Transcriptomics;
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Biochemistry, Cancer Biology, Molecular Biology, R Data Analysis for Bioinformatics and BioPython;
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with anything possible ;D
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've working with computation all these years, but I prefer Biology than Computation  :P

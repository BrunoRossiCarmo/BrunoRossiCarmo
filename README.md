### 🙌 Hello There! 🙌

I'm a **Physics** student of University of São Paulo - IFSC. 
Also, I was already a student of the Biomedical Informatics course, but I interrupted the graduation journey in this course to replace it with physics. Basically, you would think that name "Biomedical Informatics" doesn't make any sense at all, but trust me, biomedical information and data science aren't as far apart as you probably thought...
If you want to know more about this course, here's his page: [Biomedica Informatics - USP](https://ibm.fmrp.usp.br/) | [Institutional Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpGVfwBcSn0) | [Institutional Video from Physics-IFSC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kf1sB_i8S0&ab_channel=PRG.ONLINEUSP)


Exclusively, I have already worked with Bioinformatics (*Computational Biology*), that the key objective here is study all the information about the omics areas, like:
- *Genomics* 🧬
- *Transcriptomics* 🧪
- *Proteomics* 🔬
- *Epigenomics* ⚗️
- *And much more stuff*...

**About Me:**
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a series of training analysis focus on Transcriptomics;
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Biochemistry, Cancer Biology, Molecular Biology, R Data Analysis for Bioinformatics and BioPython;
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with anything possible ;D
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've working with computation all these years, but I prefer Biology than Computation  :P
